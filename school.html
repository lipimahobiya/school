<p>private school is a school not administered or funded by the government, unlike a public school.[note 1] Private schools
(also known as 'independent schools') are schools that are not dependent upon national or local government to finance
their financial endowment.[1] Unless privately owned they typically have a board of governors and have a system of
governance that ensures their independent operation.</p>
